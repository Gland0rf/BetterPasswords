# BetterPasswords
<h1>Project Preview</h1>

This project contains a password manager, that stores your files via an AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) Algorithm, making them really hard to crack. For now, there only is a GUI, but maybe there will be CLI support in the furture.
This program is written in python and was compiled so an exe, basically only making it available on windows devices.

<h1>How to install</h1>
Navigate to the /releases tab of this repo, and download the standalone installer. It will generate a shortcut for you that you can access through the windows search bar, and store it's files into "C:\Program Files (x86)\BetterPasswords". There isn't a real desintaller yet, so if you want to remove the program, delete the directory mentionened before, and (if you ran the program) the Directory "C:\BetterPasswords" and you should be good to go.

<h1>How to use</h1>
it's pretty straight forward. Create a main password, which you hopefully won't forget. In case you do, there will be a reset button. Note that you can't recover your saved passwords after you reset your main password, because all the passwords are encrypted via a key, basically making them nearly impossible to retrieve without the main password.
