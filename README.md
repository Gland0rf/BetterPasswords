# BetterPasswords
<h1>Project Overview</h1>

BetterPasswords is a Password Manager, that securely stores your passwords via AES (Advanced Encryption Standard), making them bascially mpossible to crack. For now, there only is a GUI, but maybe there will be CLI support in the furture.
This program is written in python and was compiled so an exe, only making it available on windows devices.

<h1>How to install/uninstall</h1>
Navigate to the /releases tab of this repo, and download the standalone installer. The installer will guide you through the installation process and generate a shortcut which lets you access the Password Manager via start menu. If you wish to uninstall this program, navigate to your installation path and run the uninstall file.

<h1>How to use</h1>
On your first launch you will have to create a master password. Do **not** forget this password, because all your saved sub-passwords will be lost if you do so. You can generate those sub-passwords after logging in by giving them a name and their associated password. Those will be saved encrypted in binary located at "C:\Users\<USER>\AppData\Roaming\BetterPasswords\data".
